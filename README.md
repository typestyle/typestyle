Writing CSS with TypeStyle will be just as fluent as writing JavaScript with TypeScript.

There are quite a few css in js frameworks out there. This one is different:

- Provides great TypeScript developer experience.
- No custom AST transform or module loader support needed.
- Works with any framework (react, angular2, [cyclejs](https://twitter.com/waynemaurer/status/788483714196078593), whatever, doesn't matter).
- Zero config. Just use.
- *super* **small**

## Quickstart

Use it like you would use CSS modules or CSS in general with webpack etc, but this time you get to use TypeScript / JavaScript!

**Install**
`npm install typestyle --save`

**Use**
```tsx
/** Import */
import {style} from "typestyle";

/** convert a style object to a CSS class name */
const className = style({color: 'red'});

/** Use the class name in a framework of choice */
//  e.g. React
const MyButton =
  ({onClick,children})
    => <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>
        {children}
      </button>
// or Angular2
@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: `<div class="${className}">Tada</div>`
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

## Guide
We really really want to make CSS maintainable and simple. So we even wrote a free and open source book, covering the super simple core API, a handful of utility styles in [`csx`](https://github.com/typestyle/csx) and tons of other goodness ðŸŒ¹. *[Jump to the guide][book]*
